# Title
Selection of Golang as the programming language

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need to pick a programming language to write our project in.

## Decision

We're deciding to use Go because it has several features conducive to a Redis clone - namely multithreading, concurrency, and speed

## Consequences

Positive: We will make heavy use of the concurrency features to achieve the performance that Redis is known for.
Negative: This is a new language for me, so there is some learning overhead to deal with.
